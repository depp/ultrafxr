# Intern at the Apocalypse

These are the audio files from the JS13K 2019 game, _I Want to Help Fight the Demon Overlord, but Iâ€™m Just an Intern!_ ([GitHub](https://github.com/depp/intern-apocalypse/)).

This includes two sounds that were dropped during development: `clang.lisp` and `sweep.lisp`.
