# UltraFXR JavaScript Engine

Status: Unusable, in development as of March 2020.

This directory contains the UltraFXR synthesis engine, written in JavaScript. The synthesis engine runs compiled UltraFXR programs and produces audio data as output. The engine does not use the DOM API and works both in the browser and in Node.
